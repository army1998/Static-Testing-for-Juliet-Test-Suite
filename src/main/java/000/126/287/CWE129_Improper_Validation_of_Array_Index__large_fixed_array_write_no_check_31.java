 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: large_fixed Set data to a value greater than the size of the array
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_write_no_check
 *    GoodSink: Write to array after verifying index
 *    BadSink : Write to array without any verification of index
 * Flow Variant: 31 Data flow: make a copy of data within the same method
