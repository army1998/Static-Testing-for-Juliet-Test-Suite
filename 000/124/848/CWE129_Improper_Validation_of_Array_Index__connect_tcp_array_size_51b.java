 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: connect_tcp Read data using an outbound tcp connection
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_size
 *    GoodSink: data is used to set the size of the array and it must be greater than 0
 *    BadSink : data is used to set the size of the array, but it could be set to 0
 * Flow Variant: 51 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one function to another in different classes in the same package
